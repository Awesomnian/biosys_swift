# Audio Format Diagnostic Guide

## üéØ Current Situation

**Upload is WORKING** ‚úÖ  
FileSystem.uploadAsync() successfully uploads files to BirdNET server.

**BirdNET can't read files** ‚ùå  
Server returns: `"Format not recognised"`

---

## üîç Diagnostic Steps

### Step 1: Test BirdNET with Known-Good File

Test if BirdNET Docker container is working at all:

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
# Using Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell's curl)
$file = "C:\AI\biosys_swift\BirdNET-Analyzer\birdnet_analyzer\example\soundscape.wav"
$uri = "https://pruinose-alise-uncooled.ngrok-free.dev/inference/"

# Create multipart form
$form = @{
    file = Get-Item -Path $file
}

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $uri -Method Post -Form $form -Headers @{"ngrok-skip-browser-warning"="true"}
```

**Expected:** Status 200 with JSON predictions  
**If this fails:** BirdNET Docker issue  
**If this works:** Problem is with mobile audio files

### Step 2: Extract Audio File from Phone

The app creates files at:
```
file:///data/user/0/host.exp.exponent/cache/ExperienceData/%2540anonymous%252Fbiosys-swift-.../Audio/recording-xxx.m4a
```

**Option A: Save to Supabase First**
Temporarily modify the code to save the file before upload, then download and test it.

**Option B: Use Android Debug Bridge (ADB)**
```bash
# List Android devices
adb devices

# Pull audio file from device
adb pull /data/user/0/host.exp.exponent/cache/ExperienceData/@anonymous/biosys-swift-*/Audio/ ./test-audio/

# Test with BirdNET
curl -X POST https://pruinose-alise-uncooled.ngrok-free.dev/inference/ -F "file=@./test-audio/recording-xxx.m4a" -H "ngrok-skip-browser-warning: true"
```

### Step 3: Check Audio Recording

Possible issues:
1. **Recording not starting** - File created but empty
2. **Encoder incompatibility** - AAC format not compatible
3. **File corruption during transfer**

**Test by checking file size:**
- 5 seconds at 44.1kHz, 1 channel, 128kbps ‚âà 80KB ‚úÖ (matches your logs!)
- If file was empty it would be <1KB
- File size looks correct, so recording IS working

---

## üîß Possible Solutions

### Solution A: Test with ffmpeg Conversion

If you have ffmpeg installed:
```bash
# Convert one of the phone's m4a files to wav
ffmpeg -i recording.m4a -ar 44100 -ac 1 recording-converted.wav

# Test converted file
curl -X POST https://pruinose-alise-uncooled.ngrok-free.dev/inference/ -F "file=@recording-converted.wav"
```

### Solution B: Check BirdNET Supported Formats

According to BirdNET documentation, it supports:
- WAV (PCM, preferred)
- MP3
- M4A/AAC
- FLAC
- OGG

Since M4A is supported, the issue might be:
- Specific AAC codec variant
- Missing audio metadata
- File header corruption

### Solution C: Try Direct File Path (No FileSystem.uploadAsync)

Create a simple test that uploads the file using Python/Node.js on the server side to verify BirdNET works:

```python
import requests

with open('test.m4a', 'rb') as f:
    files = {'file': f}
    response = requests.post('http://localhost:8080/inference/', files=files)
    print(response.json())
```

---

## üêõ Likely Root Cause

The issue is probably that **FileSystem.uploadAsync() might not be sending the file data correctly**, or **Android's AAC encoder creates files BirdNET can't parse**.

### Evidence:
1. ‚úÖ File size is correct (82KB)
2. ‚úÖ Upload completes successfully  
3. ‚úÖ BirdNET receives request
4. ‚ùå BirdNET can't open the BytesIO object
5. ‚ùå "Format not recognised" despite M4A being supported

This suggests the file **data** is corrupt or malformed, even though the file **size** is correct.

---

## üí° Alternative Approach

### Use Supabase Storage Proxy (Original Architecture)

Instead of direct upload:

1. **Upload audio to Supabase Storage** (we know this works)
2. **Trigger Supabase Edge Function**
3. **Edge Function downloads from Storage**
4. **Edge Function uploads to BirdNET**
5. **Returns results to app**

This bypasses FileSystem.uploadAsync() entirely and uses proven Supabase uploads.

**Would require:**
- Updating supabase/functions/analyze-birdcall/index.ts
- Modifying storageService to upload first
- Edge function handles BirdNET communication

---

## üéØ Immediate Next Step

**Test BirdNET with a known-good audio file using PowerShell/curl** to confirm Docker container is working correctly.

If that works, the issue is definitely with how the mobile audio files are being encoded/uploaded.

If that fails, BirdNET Docker setup has an issue.
