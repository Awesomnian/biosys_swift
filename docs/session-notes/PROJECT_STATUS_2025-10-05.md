# BioSys Swift - Comprehensive Project Status
**Date:** 2025-10-05 15:18 AEDT
**Status:** ‚ùå BROKEN - Needs Investigation & Fix

---

## üéØ What This App Should Do

A mobile bioacoustic monitoring app that:
1. **Records audio** continuously in 5-second segments
2. **Gets GPS location** for each recording
3. **Analyzes audio** with BirdNET to detect Swift Parrots
4. **Stores detections** with audio file + GPS coordinates + timestamp

**Simple. Three components. All must work.**

---

## ‚úÖ What WAS Working (4.5 Hours Ago - ~9:30 PM)

### Working State:
- ‚úÖ App initialized successfully
- ‚úÖ GPS location acquired
- ‚úÖ Microphone permission granted
- ‚úÖ Audio recording (M4A format)
- ‚úÖ "Start Monitoring" button functional
- ‚úÖ Button visual states (Green ‚Üí Amber ‚Üí Red)
- ‚úÖ Audio uploaded to BirdNET

### Only Issue Then:
**BirdNET returned 500 "Format not recognised" errors**
- Audio files were being created and uploaded
- BirdNET couldn't parse the M4A format from the mobile app
- This was the ONLY problem to solve

---

## ‚ùå What's BROKEN Now (Current Build)

### Critical Failures:
1. **GPS tracking hangs** - `locationService.startTracking()` never returns
2. **Microphone permission hangs** - `Audio.requestPermissionsAsync()` never returns  
3. **Button shows no visual feedback** - Used to change Green ‚Üí Amber ‚Üí Red
4. **"Start Monitoring" gets stuck on "Initiating"** - Never reaches "Monitoring Active"

### What Still Works:
- ‚úÖ App installs
- ‚úÖ Initial app load
- ‚úÖ Device ID creation
- ‚úÖ Model initialization (Supabase, BirdNET)

---

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Permission API Blocking:
Both GPS and audio permission requests are **blocking indefinitely** in the development build.

**Evidence:**
```
Logs show: "Requesting microphone permission..."
Then: [HANGS FOREVER]
Never shows: "Permission granted" or "Permission denied"
```

### Possible Causes:
1. **Development build permission handling broken** - Expo Go vs dev build difference
2. **Permission dialog not showing** - Silently blocking
3. **React Native permission APIs incompatible** with development build
4. **Android 14+ permission changes** - Newer Android OS restrictions

### What Changed:
Between working state and now:
- Switched from Expo Go to Development Build
- Added comprehensive error handling (which added bloat)
- Multiple permission request attempts
- Location/audio permission logic modified

---

## üìÅ Documentation Cleanup Needed

Many are redundant, outdated, or cover the same topics:

**Keep (Core Documents):**
1. `README.md` - Project overview
2. `PROJECT_STATUS_2025-10-05.md` - THIS FILE - Current state
3. `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Original architecture plan

## üèóÔ∏è Current Architecture

### What's Implemented:
```
Mobile App (React Native + Expo)
  ‚Üì Records audio (M4A, 5s segments)
  ‚Üì Upload to Supabase Storage  
  ‚Üì Call Supabase Edge Function with storage path
  ‚Üì
Supabase Edge Function
  ‚Üì Downloads audio from storage
  ‚Üì Creates FormData
  ‚Üì POST to BirdNET API (via ngrok)
  ‚Üì
BirdNET Docker Container
  ‚Üì Analyzes audio
  ‚Üì Returns predictions
  ‚Üì
Edge Function ‚Üí Mobile App
  ‚Üì Save to Supabase detections table
```

### Infrastructure Status:
- ‚úÖ Docker BirdNET running (localhost:8080)
- ‚úÖ ngrok tunnel active (https://pruinose-alise-uncooled.ngrok-free.dev)
- ‚úÖ Supabase project (phayiovbyaaqimlshmxo.supabase.co)
- ‚úÖ Edge Function deployed
- ‚ùå Mobile app permissions broken

## üîß What Needs to Be Fixed

### Priority 1: Permission Blocking
**Problem:** Both GPS and audio permissions hang forever
**Why Critical:** App can't function without these
**Potential Solutions:**
1. Check if permissions already granted (don't re-request)
2. Use different permission API
3. Test on different Android version
4. Check development build manifest configuration

### Priority 2: Button Visual Feedback
**Problem:** Button doesn't show state changes
**Why Critical:** User can't tell what's happening
**Potential Solutions:**
1. Check if state updates are triggering re-renders
2. Verify button styling logic
3. Check if `setIsStarting()` is actually updating state

### Priority 3: Audio Format
**Problem:** BirdNET returned 500 errors for M4A files
**Why Critical:** Core functionality
**Status:** Unknown if still an issue (can't get to testing)
**Potential Solutions:**
1. Test with WAV format instead
2. Verify M4A encoding settings
3. Test BirdNET with phone-generated M4A manually

## üìä Code State

### Services:
- `services/audioCapture.ts` - Records M4A audio, returns file URI
- `services/detectionModelBirdNET.ts` - Uploads to Supabase Storage‚ÜíEdge Function
- `services/sensorService.ts` - Orchestrates audio + GPS + ML
- `services/locationService.ts` - GPS tracking
- `services/storageService.ts` - Supabase database operations

### Current Issues in Code:
- Excessive debug logging (hundreds of lines)
- Permission requests blocking without timeout
- No graceful degradation
- Too many try-catch wrappers obscuring actual issues

---

## üîÑ Recommended Next Steps (Tomorrow)

### Option A: Minimal Fix Approach
1. Find git commit from 4.5 hours ago when app was working
2. Review ONLY the permission handling code from that version
3. Compare to current broken version
4. Restore just the permission logic
5. Test if monitoring works again
6. Then tackle BirdNET audio format issue ONLY

### Option B: Clean Development Build
1. Create fresh development build with MINIMAL changes
2. Use proven permission patterns from Expo documentation
3. Don't add excessive logging
4. Test core functionality first
5. Add features incrementally

### Option C: Investigate Permission Blocking
1. Check Android settings - are permissions already granted?
2. If yes, app shouldn't request again
3. Add logic to check existing permissions before requesting
4. Only request if not already granted

## üóÇÔ∏è File Cleanup Actions

### To Delete (Redundant/Outdated):
Move to `docs/archive/`:
- All diagnostic guides (10+ files)
- All status files except this one (8+ files)
- All testing guides (consolidated here)

### To Keep:
- README.md (project overview)
- PROJECT_STATUS_2025-10-05.md (this file)
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (architecture reference)
- package.json, app.json, eas.json (required configs)

### To Create Tomorrow:
- PERMISSION_FIX_PLAN.md (specific solution for permission hanging)
- MINIMAL_TEST_GUIDE.md (simple test steps without bloat)

---

## üí° Key Insights

### What Went Wrong:
1. **Over-engineering the fix** - Added logging instead of fixing root cause
2. **Treating symptoms** - Timeouts don't solve blocking APIs
3. **Scope creep** - Started with audio format, ended up rewriting everything
4. **Lost working state** - Had functional app, broke it trying to fix minor issue

### What to Do Differently:
1. **Identify exact breaking change** - Find commit where it broke
2. **Minimal changes** - Fix ONE thing at a time
3. **Test immediately** - Don't add multiple changes before testing
4. **Rollback fast** - If change breaks something, revert immediately

---

## üéØ Critical Questions for Tomorrow

1. **Permission State:** Are GPS and mic permissions already granted in Android settings?
2. **Git History:** Can we identify the exact commit where monitoring stopped working?
3. **Development Build vs Expo Go:** Is there a fundamental incompatibility?
4. **Android Version:** Are you on Android 14+ with new permission model?

---

## üìû For Next Session

**Start Fresh With:**
1. This consolidated status document
2. Git log review to find working commit
3. Minimal targeted fix
4. Test immediately
5. One issue at a time

**Do NOT:**
1. Add more logging before fixing actual issues
2. Make multiple changes at once
3. Add timeouts/workarounds instead of real fixes
4. Create more documentation files

---

## üîÑ Immediate Actions (End of Today)

1. Create `docs/archive/2025-10-05/` folder
2. Move all redundant docs there
3. Commit current state to git with clear message
4. Document exact blocking points
5. Leave clean slate for tomorrow

---

**This is a reset point. Tomorrow we fix the actual permission blocking issue, not work around it.**
