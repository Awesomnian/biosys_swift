# Action Plan for Tomorrow

**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Goal:** Get the app working again

---

## 🎯 Primary Objective

Fix permission APIs so monitoring can start. That's it.

---

## 🔍 Investigation Steps

### Step 1: Check Permission State on Phone
**Before any code changes:**
1. Settings → Apps → BioSys Swift → Permissions
2. Check current state of:
   - Location: Allowed/Denied?
   - Microphone: Allowed/Denied?
3. If BOTH are "Allowed" → App shouldn't request again
4. This might be why permission APIs hang

### Step 2: Test Permission Check Logic
Add code to CHECK permissions before REQUESTING:
```typescript
// Check if already granted
const { status } = await Audio.getPermissionsAsync();
if (status === 'granted') {
  // Skip request, proceed
} else {
  // Request permission
}
```

### Step 3: Review Git History
Find commit from ~21:00 (9 PM) when monitoring was working.
Compare permission handling between then and now.

---

## 🔧 Specific Fixes Needed

### Fix 1: Permission Handling
**Current:** `requestPermissionsAsync()` blocks forever
**Fix:** Check if already granted first, then request only if needed

### Fix 2: Button Visual State
**Current:** No visual feedback when pressed
**Fix:** Check if state updates trigger re-renders

### Fix 3: Remove Excessive Logging
**Current:** Hundreds of debug lines
**Fix:** Keep only critical error logs

## ⚠️ What NOT to Do

1. ❌ Don't add more timeouts
2. ❌ Don't add more try-catch wrappers
3. ❌ Don't create more documentation
4. ❌ Don't make multiple changes at once

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

App should:
1. Start without hanging
2. Request permissions (or skip if already granted)
3. Button shows visual feedback (Green → Amber → Red)
4. "Start Monitoring" actually starts monitoring
5. Audio segments recorded every 5 seconds
6. GPS coordinates captured
7. BirdNET analysis returns results

**All three core components must work: Audio + GPS + BirdNET**

## 📋 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Permissions already granted in Android settings?
- [ ] Permission check before request?
- [ ] Button click handler fires?
- [ ] Audio recording starts?
- [ ] GPS tracking starts?
- [ ] Files upload to Supabase Storage?
- [ ] Edge Function processes requests?
- [ ] BirdNET returns predictions?

---

## 🔄 If All Else Fails

Restore to git commit from 21:00 when it was working.
Fix ONLY the BirdNET audio format issue.
Nothing else.

---

**Keep it simple. Fix the core issues. Get it working.**
