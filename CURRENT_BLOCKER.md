# Current Blocker - App Crashes on Launch

## 🚨 Issue

**Development Build APK crashes immediately to desktop when opened.**

## 📊 What We Know

**Working:**
- ✅ APK built and installed successfully
- ✅ App connects to Metro bundler (192.168.1.105:8081)
- ✅ Permissions granted (GPS + Microphone)
- ✅ Initialization starts (saw "Initializing sensor..." in logs)

**Failing:**
- ❌ App crashes during initialization
- ❌ Last log: "Device ID: sensor_1759665121619_1o745gaxf"
- ❌ Crashes before completing sensor setup

## 🔍 Likely Causes

1. **Supabase client initialization fails** (invalid credentials)
2. **Location service crashes** (permission issue)
3. **Model initialization fails** (BirdNET model creation)
4. **Missing dependency** in Development Build

## 🛠️ Next Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Check Crash Logs

**On your phone:**
1. Open app
2. Let it crash
3. Immediately run: `adb logcat | findstr "BioSys"`
4. Look for crash stack trace

### Step 2: Simplify Initialization

Try removing complex initialization to isolate the issue.

### Step 3: Check Supabase Credentials

Verify .env has correct values for new project:
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://phayiovbyaaqimlshmxo.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

### Step 4: Rebuild with Error Handling

Add try-catch around initialization and rebuild.

## 📝 What's in Git

All code and documentation is committed:
- https://github.com/Awesomnian/biosys_swift
- Commit: "After lengthy troubleshooting... accidentally built Android app"
- 13 documentation files
- Backup in "Rescued from Bolt" folder

## 🎯 To Continue Later

1. Debug crash (check logcat)
2. Fix initialization issue
3. Rebuild APK
4. Test monitoring

## 💡 Alternative Approach

If crash persists, consider:
- Use web version for POC demo
- Test on different Android device
- Try iOS build instead
- Simplify initialization logic

**The architecture and code are solid. Just need to debug this Development Build crash.**
